## Configuration

### Audio Setup (Critical!)

The bot needs to capture system audio to record the meeting participants. This requires specific audio configuration:

#### Windows
1. Right-click speaker icon ‚Üí "Open Sound settings"
2. Scroll to "Advanced sound options" ‚Üí "App volume and device preferences"
3. Enable "Stereo Mix" in Recording devices:
   - Right-click in Recording area
   - Check "Show Disabled Devices" and "Show Disconnected Devices"
   - Right-click "Stereo Mix" ‚Üí "Enable"

#### Windows 11
 To enable Stereo Mix on Windows 11, right-click the speaker icon in the system tray and select "Open sound settings". Navigate to "More sound settings" and then the "Recording" tab. If Stereo Mix is not visible, right-click and select "Show disabled devices" and "Show disconnected devices". Right-click on Stereo Mix and select "Enable". If it still doesn't appear, your sound card or drivers might need updating.

#### macOS
1. Install additional audio software:
   - [BlackHole](https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole) (recommended)
   - [Soundflower](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower)
2. System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
3. Enable access for Terminal/Python

#### Linux
```bash
# Install PulseAudio tools
sudo apt install pavucontrol

# Enable audio loopback
sudo modprobe snd-aloop
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Test your setup:**
```bash
python test_setup.py
```

2. **Run the enhanced dual audio bot:**
```bash
python dual_audio_bot.py
```

3. **Process existing recordings (optional):**
```bash
python process_recording.py
```

### Recording Types

The bot supports three recording types with tailored AI summaries:

#### 1. Google Meet üé•
Optimized for meeting recordings with focus on:
- Decisions made and action items
- Key discussion points
- Participant contributions
- Follow-up tasks

#### 2. Lesson üìö
Perfect for educational content with emphasis on:
- Learning objectives and key concepts
- Important explanations and examples
- Questions and answers
- Practical applications

#### 3. Video üé¨
General purpose recording for:
- Tutorials and demonstrations
- Presentations and webinars
- Any other video content

### Recording Options

#### 1. Full Screen Recording (Recommended)
- Records entire screen with dual audio
- Perfect for meetings and lessons
- Automatic duration or manual stop

#### 2. Screen Region Recording
- Select specific area to record
- Reduces file size
- Good for focused content

#### 3. Manual Control
- Start/stop recording manually
- Maximum flexibility
- Interactive control during recording

## Session Organization

The bot automatically organizes each recording into a timestamped session directory:

```
sessions/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Lesson_MyTopic_20250120_143000/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio.wav              # Mixed system + microphone audio
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ video.avi              # Screen recording
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ transcript.txt         # Full transcription
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ summary.txt            # AI-generated summary
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session_info.json      # Session metadata
```

### File Details

- **`audio.wav`** - High-quality mixed audio (system + microphone)
- **`video.avi`** - Screen recording with optimized compression
- **`transcript.txt`** - Complete transcription from video or mixed audio
- **`summary.txt`** - AI-powered summary tailored to recording type
- **`session_info.json`** - Metadata including transcript source and processing details

### Directory Naming Convention

- **Google Meet**: `GoogleMeet_[CustomName]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- **Lesson**: `Lesson_[LessonName]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- **Video**: `Video_[CustomName]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`

### Enhanced Audio Processing

The system uses a smart audio selection approach:
1. **First**: Attempts to extract audio directly from video (most accurate)
2. **Fallback**: Uses mixed audio if video has no audio stream
3. **Metadata**: Records which audio source was used for transparency

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Audio Recording Problems
```bash
# Test available audio devices during bot startup
python dual_audio_bot.py

# The bot will show detected audio devices
# If no system audio device found:
# - Check Windows Stereo Mix is enabled
# - Install additional audio software on macOS
# - Configure PulseAudio on Linux
```

#### 2. FFmpeg Issues
```bash
# Test FFmpeg installation
ffmpeg -version

# If not found, reinstall:
# Windows: Download from FFmpeg.org
# macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# Linux: sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

#### 3. Whisper Model Loading Issues
```bash
# Clear Whisper cache and reinstall
pip uninstall openai-whisper
pip install openai-whisper==20231117
```

#### 4. Ollama Connection Problems
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
ollama list

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# Pull required model
ollama pull mistral
```

### Audio Permissions

If you get permission errors:

1. **Windows**: Run as Administrator initially
2. **macOS**: Grant microphone access to Terminal
3. **Linux**: Add user to audio group:
```bash
sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER
```

## Customization

### Using Different AI Models

Replace `mistral` with other Ollama models in `process_recording.py`:

```python
# Edit line in generate_summary() function
# Available models: llama2, codellama, vicuna, phi, etc.
response = ollama.chat(
    model='llama2',  # Change this to your preferred model
    messages=messages
)
```

### Command Line Processing

Process existing recordings with custom parameters:

```bash
# Process specific files
python process_recording.py --audio mixed_audio.wav --video recording.avi

# Specify recording type and custom name
python process_recording.py --type lesson --name "Advanced Python"

# Process without prompts (use default values)
python process_recording.py --audio audio.wav --video video.avi --type meeting --name "Team Sync" --no-prompts
```

### Custom Summarization Prompts

Modify the prompts in `process_recording.py` for different recording types:

```python
# For Google Meet recordings
meet_prompt = """
Analyze this meeting transcript and provide:
1. Key decisions made
2. Action items with assignees
3. Important discussion points
4. Follow-up tasks
"""

# For Lesson recordings
lesson_prompt = """
Analyze this lesson transcript and provide:
1. Main learning objectives covered
2. Key concepts explained
3. Practical examples demonstrated
4. Questions and answers
"""
```

## Security & Privacy

- ‚úÖ **All processing is local** - no data sent to external services
- ‚úÖ **Open-source models** - Whisper and Ollama models run offline
- ‚úÖ **No API keys required** - completely self-contained
- ‚úÖ **Session organization** - automatic cleanup and structured storage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Audio files stored locally** - ensure proper file permissions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Screen recording** - captures all visible content during recording

## Performance Considerations

- **RAM Usage**: Whisper models require 1-4GB RAM
- **Processing Time**: ~1-2 minutes per hour of audio for transcription
- **Storage**: ~50MB per hour for dual audio + video (compressed)
- **CPU**: Transcription and video processing are CPU-intensive
- **FFmpeg dependency**: Required for video audio extraction

## Legal Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always comply with local laws and meeting policies:

- Get consent from all participants before recording
- Check your organization's recording policies
- Respect privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Only record meetings you're authorized to record
